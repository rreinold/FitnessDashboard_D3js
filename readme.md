##Purpose

###Technical Goals
Hands-on practice using Mike Bostock's D3.js library, and refine my web development skills

###Personal Growth Goals
Improve success rate of fitness goals via fusing, tracking, and analyzing a variety of datasets. I also hope to bring about the Hawthorne effect, which is a type of reactivity in which individuals modify or improve an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed.

##Datasets
####Exercise Events
Track and display any significant exercise performed. This includes gym sessions, hiking, running, basketballs, and other sports.

####Body Composition
Full Body composition analysis performed at NutriShop Austin-South on a rough weekly schedule.

####Diet
Maintain high-level record of eating habits. Leverage MyFitnessPal API to pull data about my diet.
